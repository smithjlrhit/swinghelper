<h1>SwingHelper project</h1>
<p>The goal of this project is to collect, test and discuss all kinds of debugging techniques for Swing</p>

<p>Every experienced Swing developer knows that Swing components must be accessed from Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) only,<br>
working with JComponents from any other thread may lead to unpredictable result.</p>

<p>But how EDT rule violations can be found ?</p>

<p><font color="darkblue">org.swinghelper.debug.CheckThreadViolationRepaintManager</font> will help you to find EDT rule violations in your code</p>

<p>More stuff is coming...</p>
